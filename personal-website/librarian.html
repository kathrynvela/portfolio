           <h4>Summary</h4>
             <p>In May 2018, my previous jointly-funded position became fully funded by WSU Spokane and I concentrated soley on providing liaison library services to the speech and hearing sciences, nutrition and exercise physiology, and newly launched medical programs. I provided classroom instruction about evidence-based practice, using citation management software, and in-depth database searching, in addition to delivering a series of online library workshops. I regularly provided one-on-one reference consultations with students, faculty, staff, and clinicians while also offering my assistance with expert literature searches. To improve research data management (RDM) practices on campus, I launched a grant-funded collaborative learning space called the Research Hub where I offered instruction and consultations related to RDM. I also created an interprofessional book club with my colleague to foster discussions around diversity and empathy in patient care.</p>

To maximize our outreach efforts, I designed and delivered an regular series of online workshops for Washtington state nurses certified for 1.0 CNE. I also provided these workshops for physicians, nurses, and allied health professionals in face-to-face sessions throughout Eastern Washington. To supplement this outreach, I participated as an exhibitor for HEALWA at health professions conferences in Washington State.</p>
